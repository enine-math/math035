# Problem No. 35

## Circular Primes

The number, $197$, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: $197$, $971$, and $719$, are themselves prime.

There are thirteen such primes below $100$: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79$, and $97$.

## Part A

How many circular primes are there below one million?

Update the function `answer()` in `solution.py` with your solution.

## Part B

Generalize the solution in Part A to find all the circular primes in the range $[p, q]$ 

Update the function `solver()` in `solution.py` with your generalized solution.

## Instructions

Create a new directory in your math problem repo (math) called `math035`

Copy README.md and solution.py into `math035`

Share your solution by updating `answer()` and `solver()` in solution.py.
